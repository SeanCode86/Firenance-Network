# 🔥Firenance! Network 
*A network protocol for* **➰Firefly!** *App & DApp*  

> **🔥Firenance! Network** is a web framework, running an encryption protocol, dubbed **🔥FireCrypt!** It is a communcation protocol for a
social media app envisoned as **'➰Firefly!'**. **➰Firefly!** is a life-long project between me (**SeanCode👽**) & **SBO Consulting CC** 
https://sboconsulting.co.za. **➰Firefly!** is aimed to become a *Decentralized-Autonomous Organization* (DAO) of a Social Media Application. Running
a 'Web2.0-to-3.0' consensus of a Merkle Tree Data Structure, which will define a Blockchain and *Open* or *Decentralized* Digital Ledger. As it is
a Social Media App, aimed to be a DAO on the Blockchain, we use the by-product the encryption produces as crytographic digital coins, to form a monetary 
system for social content creators to earn revenue on the Social Media Platform. Seeing that this idea is expressed across the social media concept,
I find it ethically valid to hash the platform's cryptocurrency in Elliptical Ring Functions from Algebraic Group Theory, which will make it a privacy
digital coin, very much like Monero, ZCash or MobileCoin. To make the concept objective to the *real world*, and get it to work as *'real-world system'*,
I see building the DAO producing three types of cryptocurrencies, as to make it easier and safer for social content creators to monetize their efforts
on the platform. 

The Three Cryptocurrencies envisioned to achieve a Proof-of-Concept are as follows;

1. **🔥Firecoin!**
2. **🔥Firetoken!**
3. **🌐FireTON!**

## 1). 🔥Firecoin!

**🔥Firecoin!** is cryptocurrency, intended to be in the form of a Privacy Coin like **Monero**, **ZCash** or **MobileCoin**. It's biggest inspiration comes
from **Monero**, however unlike **Monero**, and more like **Bitcoin**, there will only be a finite supply of coins possible to mine, and transact with.
In my true eccentric thinking, I make this finite supply 2.5 times of that of **Bitcoin**, so thus namely, there will only be **52,000,000** *firecoins*
available to mine from a network of computer nodes. **🔥Firecoin!** aims to achieve a Proof-Concept I call ***rPoW*** or **Recursive/Ring Proof-of-Work**,
which is an entirely new mathematical model to electrically improve the effciency of the consensus's hash function. 

## 2). 🔥Firetoken!

**🔥Firetoken!** is the Social Media Platform's arbitary & liquidity *crypto-memetoken*. *Firetokens!'* are arbitary, and therefore, there is an infinite supply of them.
It operates as a cryptocurrency, using a 'Progressive' Paradigm of Scrypt Encryption, making *'inhouse-tokens'* to work with the **🔥FireBot! API Platform**.
These are only exchangable within **➰Firefly!**, using **🔥Firenance! Network.**

## 3). 🌐FireTON!

This makes the Ecosystem's *'Microtoken'* and TON-based fungible Stablecoin. **🌐FireTON!** is a type of Stablecoin whereby it acts as a *'reward-token'* 
on the Telegram Payments API & The Open Network. It is regulated through its consensus, using TON's *Proof-of-Stake* (PoS), 
A ***'Micro-Social'*** App of the **➰Firefly!** Ecosystem of Apps & dApps, bridging the Telegram Cloud Platfom, TON-Blockchain through *'firestreams'* 
of threaded network fibres to **🔥Firenance! Network** & the **🔥FireBot! API Platform**
